# Exploring R packages - FISH 497 Winter 2021 Assignment 7
I am embarassed to say that I do not use many packages for the work I have conducted thus far. However, I have extensively used 'RColorBrewer' in my base plot work.

##Package title
`RColorBrewer`

##Location
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RColorBrewer/RColorBrewer.pdf) is likely the best place. However, the folks who created the resource do have a source [GitHub](https://github.com/axismaps/colorbrewer/) that is related to their [website](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3).

##Vignette(s)
This package has 9 vignettes, one for each function. 

##Application(s)
There are SO many. Here are a few:

Review
The purpose of 'RColorBrewer' is to provide premade color palettes for data visualization in R. The color palettes take into account needs such as color blindness, sequential, qualitative, and diverging comparisons. I like this package because I can quickly identify colorblind friendly colors and quickly copy their RGB or HEX codes (depending on what function I am trying to use!). I also appreciate that I can build palettes up to ~12 colors long for more complicated comparisons. I do wish there were more options for larger color palettes. The package was very easy to learn how to use and I frequent the [website](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3) when I want to make my data visualization fancier. I definitely recommend this package for use for plotting that does not require more than 9-12 unique colors.
